	abstract = {Health information education plays a crucial role in training healthcare professionals to understand and manage patient data. Hands-on experience in all phases of data management and analysis is essential to empower students and enable them to apply the knowledge and skills gained from coursework to class projects and in real life scenarios. However, it is challenging for health information education to use real-world datasets directly in the classes due to security and privacy concerns. Synthetic datasets that mimic real-world healthcare data can be used as a teaching tool in health informatics education. These datasets offer numerous advantages, such as providing a consistent and reliable source of data for faculty and students, protecting patient privacy, and enabling the exploration of complex healthcare scenarios. In this paper, we demonstrate the development and implementation of three synthetic datasets across the health informatics curriculum at George Mason University. These synthetic datasets are used to teach critical skills such as database management, data integration, coding, and data mining.},

	abstract = {This paper reports on our efforts to collect daily COVID-19-related symptoms for a large public university population, as well as study relationship between reported symptoms and individual movements. We developed a set of tools to collect and integrate individual-level data. COVID-19-related symptoms are collected using a self-reporting tool initially implemented in Qualtrics survey system and consequently moved to .NET framework. Individual movement data are collected using off-the-shelf tracking apps available for iPhone and Android phones. Data integration and analysis are done in PostgreSQL, Python, and R. As of September 2020, we collected about 184,000 daily symptom responses for 20,000 individuals, as well as over 15,000 days of GPS movement data for 175 individuals. The analysis of the data indicates that headache is the most frequently reported symptom, present almost always when any other symptoms are reported as indicated by derived association rules. It is followed by cough, sore throat, and aches. The study participants traveled on average 223.61 km every week with a large standard deviation of 254.53 and visited on average 5.77Â±4.75 locations each week for at least 10 min. However, there is no evidence that reported symptoms or prior COVID-19 contact affects movements (p>.3 in most models). The evidence suggests that although some individuals limit their movements during pandemics, the overall study population do not change their movements as suggested by guidelines.},

Bio-ontologies are used to model the healthcare knowledge using a set of concepts and relationships among those concepts. Meanwhile, mainstream machine learning fo-cuses on the ability to process massive amounts of data and build accurate models, but few methods provide intelligent assistance to address challenges in the biomedical data analysis such as the complexity, heterogeneity, and semantics of healthcare data. In this paper, an ontology-guided machine learning method is described and applied to discovery of patterns of patients' characteristics affecting their ability to perform activities of daily living. Bio-ontologies are used to provide computable knowledge for machine learning methods to " understand " biomedical data. SEER-MHOS data mapped to UMLS are analyzed to discover the patterns.},
